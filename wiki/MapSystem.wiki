dtEntity allows loading multiple maps at once. Each entity that is loaded from a map or that should be saved from a map has to have a map component. This component contains a human-readable name for the entity, a unique string identifier and the path of the map to save to.

A scene file can contain a number of maps to load, also properties for initializing the various entity systems in the scene.

Maps and scenes are loaded and stored using the MapEncoder interface. There are two existing implementations for this interface: One uses RapidXML to store to XML, the other uses Xerces, also to XML. Possibly there will be binary encoding in the future.
